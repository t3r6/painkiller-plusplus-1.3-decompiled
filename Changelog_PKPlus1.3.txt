P K + + 1 . 3

=============


PK++ Mod is no longer updated because Blowfish (his lead coder) is being busy with PK:Resurrection...

We've decided to make our own unofficial PK++ 1.3.1.64 release based on the 1.2.1.64 PK++ sources

Devteam is: OriOn (code), B6 (maps), PrimeviL (gfx), sk1p, HV, kenzu (betatest)

Release is planned "When it's done" but as soon as possible ;)

Work In Progress so be patient and check often this changelog!
